# Recipe Generation with Pretrained BERT Architecture

## Overview
This project explores recipe generation using a **pretrained BERT architecture**, fine-tuned on domain-specific recipe datasets. It was part of research submitted to the **Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)** journal. The project was conducted from **March 2023 to September 2023**, during which the model demonstrated superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art recipe generation models.

The study focuses on pretraining BERT on recipe data and evaluating its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant recipes. The codebase has been **refactored for clarity and maintainability**.
